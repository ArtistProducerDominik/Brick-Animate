📘 Brick Animate – Documentation
Overview
Brick Animate is a Blender add-on for creating stunning brick-style animations without rigging or manual keyframing. With intuitive tools like Flight, Drop, and Snap Build, you can build complex sequences and special effects with just a few clicks.

🔧 Installation
Open Blender (version 4.3 or later).

Go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons.

Click Install and select the brick_animate.zip file.

Enable the add-on by checking the box next to Brick Animate.

The add-on will now appear in the 3D Viewport > Sidebar > Brick tab.

🧱 Main Features
▶️ Flight Animation
Objects fly to their target positions using a control empty. You can define sorting order, timing, and interpolation for smooth, dynamic results.

🟢 Drop Animation
Simulate objects dropping into place from above. Great for exploded views or stylized part reveals.

🔵 Snap Build
Objects "snap" from a formation (cloud, ring, cube, or line) into their final positions. Optional Snap Mix mode for more variation and motion creativity.

🌀 Special Movement (Circle Mode)
Rotate selected objects around a point (or empty) to create advanced motion effects and object reveals — with optional random rotation.

⚙️ UI Breakdown
You'll find the Brick Animate panel under 3D Viewport > Sidebar > Brick. The UI is divided into expandable sections:

🛠 Preparation
Target Size: Uniform scale for selected objects.

Prepare Objects: Sets origin and scales objects for consistent animation.

🧩 Collection Tools
Create new collections and assign selected objects.

Choose target collection for animation.

🧭 Control Empty
Create and assign a control empty as the animation origin.

🎬 Animation Settings
Start Frame, Frame Step, Duration, Offset, and Drop Height

Sort Direction: LOW, HIGH, RANDOM, or REVERSE

Snap Mix Options: Mix shape (Cloud, Ring, Line, Cube) and Radius

Interpolation Type: Choose from Bezier, Linear, Constant, etc.

▶ Animate
Run Flight, Drop, or Snap Build animations.

Enable Live Update for real-time preview while playing the timeline.

🔄 Reset
Clears all keyframes and restores objects to their original positions.

ℹ️ Support & Info
Buttons for Documentation, Help Form, and Feedback Form

🔁 Live Update
When Live Update is enabled, any change in the settings during timeline playback automatically refreshes the animation. This is perfect for fast iteration and visual feedback.

🎯 Workflow Example
Select your objects and press Prepare Objects.

Create a Collection and assign the selected objects.

Create a Control Empty at the 3D cursor.

Adjust Animation Settings (duration, sort, interpolation).

Choose an animation type: Flight, Drop, or Snap Build.

Play the animation or enable Live Update to see real-time changes.

❗ Troubleshooting
Error: “Offset must be smaller than duration”
→ Ensure your frame offset is less than the animation duration.

Objects don’t move as expected
→ Make sure you’ve used the “Prepare Objects” button and assigned a Control Empty.

Live Update not triggering
→ Confirm that the timeline is playing and “Live Update” is enabled.

📘 Brick Animate – Documentation
Overview
Brick Animate is a Blender add-on designed to bring brick-style object animations to life — no rigging, no constraints, no hassle. With tools for Flight, Drop, Snap Build, and Special Movement, it's perfect for build-ups, exploded views, creative reveals, and motion design.

🔧 Installation
Download the .zip file from Blender Market.

Open Blender (version 4.3 or newer).

Go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons.

Click Install, select the .zip file, and click Install Add-on.

Enable the add-on by checking Brick Animate.

You’ll now see a new tab called Brick in the 3D Viewport Sidebar (N key).

🚀 Core Animation Features
✈️ Flight
Objects fly in from a control empty to their final positions. Supports custom frame offset, sorting (Top-Down, Bottom-Up, Random), and reverse mode (fly back).

🪂 Drop
Objects fall vertically from a height and land at their original locations. Great for exploded views and stylized build-ups.

🔗 Snap Build
Objects "snap" from a chosen formation (cloud, ring, line, or cube) into place. Optional Snap Mix lets them start around a central anchor before building.

🔁 Live Update
When enabled, animations update in real-time as you change parameters during timeline playback — ideal for fast iteration and testing.

⚙️ UI Breakdown
You’ll find everything under 3D View > Sidebar > Brick. The interface includes:

🛠 Preparation
Target Size: Scales selected objects uniformly.

Prepare Objects: Sets origin to geometry and scales.

📦 Collection Tools
Create new collections and assign selected objects.

Choose a collection to animate from the dropdown.

🧭 Control Empty
Creates a control empty used as the animation origin point.

🎞 Animation Settings
Start Frame, Frame Step, Duration, Offset

Drop Height, Interpolation Type

Sort Direction: LOW, HIGH, RANDOM, REVERSE

Reverse Order options for Flight/Drop modes

✨ Snap Build Options
Snap Mix: Enable custom shapes (cloud, ring, cube, line)

Radius and formation shape

Anchored mixing around the lowest object

▶ Animate
Run Flight, Drop, or Snap Build

Choose interpolation (Linear, Bezier, etc.)

Enable Live Update

♻ Reset
Clears all keyframes and resets original positions

📚 Support & Info
Links to documentation, help form, and feedback form

🎯 Typical Workflow
Select your objects.

Press Prepare Objects (optional but recommended).

Create or assign a Collection.

Create a Control Empty.

Adjust Animation Settings.

Choose an animation: Flight, Drop, or Snap Build.

Press Play or enable Live Update for real-time results.

🌀 Secondary Movement (Special Motion)
This tool adds stylized circular motion to objects — great for previews, creative motion design, or special effects.

Access
Found under: 3D View > Sidebar > Brick > Special Movement

How It Works
Selected objects animate in a circular path around a center point (or an empty), with optional rotation. You can:

Set Movement Type (currently "Circle")

Adjust Movement Length (frame step)

Define Minimum Distance to avoid collisions

Add Random Rotation within defined ranges (X, Y, Z)

Choose Interpolation Mode (Constant, Linear, Bezier)

Use an Empty Object as the center (optional)

Use Case Example
Create stylized intros where parts orbit before snapping together, or use it to visualize components before assembly.

🛠 Troubleshooting
Problem	Solution
Objects not animating	Ensure a valid collection and control empty are selected
Error: Offset too large	Make sure the frame offset is less than the animation duration
Nothing happens on playback	Enable Live Update and make sure the timeline is running
Snap Mix not working	Ensure Snap Mix is enabled and a valid shape + radius is set

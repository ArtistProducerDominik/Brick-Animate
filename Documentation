📘 Brick Animate – Documentation
Overview
Brick Animate is a Blender add-on designed to bring brick-style object animations to life — no rigging, no constraints, no hassle. With tools for Flight, Drop, Snap Build, and Special Movement, it's perfect for build-ups, exploded views, creative reveals, and motion design.

🔧 Installation
Download the .zip file from Blender Market.

Open Blender (version 4.3 or newer).

Go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons.

Click Install, select the .zip file, and click Install Add-on.

Enable the add-on by checking Brick Animate.

You’ll now see a new tab called Brick in the 3D Viewport Sidebar (N key).

🚀 Core Animation Features
✈️ Flight
Objects fly in from a control empty to their final positions. Supports custom frame offset, sorting (Top-Down, Bottom-Up, Random), and reverse mode (fly back).

🪂 Drop
Objects fall vertically from a height and land at their original locations. Great for exploded views and stylized build-ups.

🔗 Snap Build
Objects "snap" from a chosen formation (cloud, ring, line, or cube) into place. Optional Snap Mix lets them start around a central anchor before building.

🔁 Live Update
When enabled, animations update in real-time as you change parameters during timeline playback — ideal for fast iteration and testing.

⚙️ UI Breakdown
You’ll find everything under 3D View > Sidebar > Brick. The interface includes:

🛠 Preparation
Target Size: Scales selected objects uniformly.

Prepare Objects: Sets origin to geometry and scales.

📦 Collection Tools
Create new collections and assign selected objects.

Choose a collection to animate from the dropdown.

🧭 Control Empty
Creates a control empty used as the animation origin point.

🎞 Animation Settings
Start Frame, Frame Step, Duration, Offset

Drop Height, Interpolation Type

Sort Direction: LOW, HIGH, RANDOM, REVERSE

Reverse Order options for Flight/Drop modes

✨ Snap Build Options
Snap Mix: Enable custom shapes (cloud, ring, cube, line)

Radius and formation shape

Anchored mixing around the lowest object

▶ Animate
Run Flight, Drop, or Snap Build

Choose interpolation (Linear, Bezier, etc.)

Enable Live Update

♻ Reset
Clears all keyframes and resets original positions

📚 Support & Info
Links to documentation, help form, and feedback form

🎯 Typical Workflow
Select your objects.

Press Prepare Objects (optional but recommended).

Create or assign a Collection.

Create a Control Empty.

Adjust Animation Settings.

Choose an animation: Flight, Drop, or Snap Build.

Press Play or enable Live Update for real-time results.

🌀 Secondary Movement (Special Motion)
This tool adds stylized circular motion to objects — great for previews, creative motion design, or special effects.

Access
Found under: 3D View > Sidebar > Brick > Special Movement

How It Works
Selected objects animate in a circular path around a center point (or an empty), with optional rotation. You can:

Set Movement Type (currently "Circle")

Adjust Movement Length (frame step)

Define Minimum Distance to avoid collisions

Add Random Rotation within defined ranges (X, Y, Z)

Choose Interpolation Mode (Constant, Linear, Bezier)

Use an Empty Object as the center (optional)

Use Case Example
Create stylized intros where parts orbit before snapping together, or use it to visualize components before assembly.

🛠 Troubleshooting
Problem	Solution

Objects not animating
Ensure a valid collection and control empty are selected

Error: Offset too large	
Make sure the frame offset is less than the animation duration

Nothing happens on playback	
Enable Live Update and make sure the timeline is running.
